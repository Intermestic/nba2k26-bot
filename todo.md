- [x] Status messages now show "cutting: PlayerName" for each bid
- [x] !regenerate-summary command available

## CURRENT TASK: Bug Fixes & Manual Processing Permission

### Issue 1: 70 OVR Bid Rejection Bug
**Problem:** Over-cap teams are being rejected when bidding on exactly 70 OVR players
**Expected:** Over-cap teams can bid on players ≤70 OVR (only reject 71+ OVR)
**Fix:** Change condition from `>= 70` to `> 70`

### Issue 2: Manual Processing Permission
**Requirement:** Only user ID 679275787664359435 can use ❗ emoji to manually process current window bids
**Implementation:** Add reaction handler for ❗ emoji with user ID check

### Phase 1: Fix 70 OVR Validation
- [x] Find over-cap bid validation code
- [x] Change `>= 70` to `> 70` in rejection logic
- [x] Update error messages to reflect correct threshold

### Phase 2: Add Manual Processing
- [x] Add ❗ emoji reaction handler
- [x] Check user ID === '679275787664359435'
- [x] Get current window bids via regenerateWindowSummary
- [x] Call processBidsFromSummary for current window
- [x] Post results with embed

### Phase 3: Test & Checkpoint
- [x] Code compiled successfully (no TypeScript errors)
- [x] 70 OVR validation fixed (now allows ≤70 OVR for over-cap teams)
- [x] Manual processing ready (❗ emoji for user 679275787664359435)
- [ ] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Fix html2canvas OKLCH Color Error

### Issue
**Error:** "Attempting to parse an unsupported color function 'oklch'"
**Cause:** html2canvas doesn't support OKLCH color format used by Tailwind CSS 4
**Location:** Download/export functionality on homepage

### Phase 1: Find Usage
- [x] Locate html2canvas import and usage (RosterCard.tsx)
- [x] Identify which component/page triggers download (RosterCard download/share)
- [x] Find OKLCH color definitions in CSS (client/src/index.css)

### Phase 2: Implement Fix
- [x] Implemented: Override CSS variables in onclone callback
- [x] Set all --background, --foreground, etc. to RGB/HEX values
- [x] Applied to both download and share functions

### Phase 3: Test & Checkpoint
- [x] Code compiled successfully (no TypeScript errors)
- [x] CSS variables overridden in onclone callback
- [x] Ready for user testing
- [ ] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Parse Historical FA Bids & Generate Summary

### Goal
Parse all bids from free agency opening to first window close, identify winning bidders, and generate window close summary for batch processing

### Phase 1: Parse Bid Data
- [x] Read pasted_content_2.txt
- [x] Extract all bid messages (Cut/Sign/Bid format)
- [x] Group bids by player
- [x] Identify highest bidder for each player
- [x] Extract: team, bidder, player signed, player dropped, bid amount

### Phase 2: Generate Summary
- [x] Create window close summary embed format
- [x] Include all 15 winning bids with cut/sign info
- [x] Posted to FA channel (Message ID: 1439332525502627880)
- [x] User can react with ⚡ to process

### Phase 3: Checkpoint
- [ ] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Fix Batch Processor Embed Parser

### Issue
Batch processor failing with "No bids found in summary message" when trying to process the manual summary

### Root Cause
Parser expects specific embed field structure but manual summary uses different format:
- Field name: Player name
- Field value: "Cut: X / Sign: Y - $Z - Team"

### Fix
- [x] Update parseSummaryMessage to handle this embed format
- [x] Extract player, cut, sign, bid, team from field value
- [x] Added Format 2 parser: "Cut: X / Sign: Y - $Z - Team"
- [x] Test with manual summary message ID: 1439332525502627880 (ready for user to react with ⚡)


## CURRENT TASK: Fix Batch Cut Execution

### Issue
Batch processor validates roster size before executing cuts, causing "already has 14 players" errors even though dropPlayer is parsed correctly

### Root Cause
Processing order is wrong:
1. Parse bids ✅
2. Validate roster size ❌ (checks before cuts happen)
3. Execute cuts
4. Execute signs

### Fix
- [x] Find processBidsFromSummary function
- [x] Adjusted validation to account for pending cuts
- [x] Roster size calculation: if dropPlayer exists, size stays same (drop 1, add 1)
- [x] Cuts execute atomically before signs in processing loop


## CURRENT TASK: Add Batch Preview Confirmation

### Goal
Add two-step confirmation for batch processing: preview → confirm → execute

### Flow
1. User reacts with ⚡ on summary message
2. Bot posts preview embed showing:
   - Total transactions count
   - List of all cuts and signs
   - Total coins to be spent
   - Any validation warnings
3. Bot adds ✅ reaction to preview message
4. User has 30 seconds to react with ✅ to confirm
5. If confirmed: execute batch processing
6. If timeout: cancel and delete preview

### Implementation
- [x] Create preview embed builder function (generateBatchPreview)
- [x] Modify ⚡ reaction handler to post preview instead of executing
- [x] Add ✅ reaction collector with 30s timeout
- [x] Move actual processing to confirmation handler
- [x] Add cancellation on timeout


## CURRENT TASK: Update Preview Display Limit

- [x] Change preview cuts display from 10 to 20
- [x] Change preview signs display from 10 to 20


## CURRENT TASK: Team Grouping & Partial Processing

### Goal 1: Group Preview by Team
- [x] Update generateBatchPreview to group transactions by team
- [x] Format: "Team: Cut X, Sign Y ($Z)"
- [x] Sort teams alphabetically
- [x] Update preview display to show teamSummaries

### Goal 2: Partial Batch Processing
- [x] Remove validation that stops entire batch on errors (converted to warnings)
- [x] Wrap each transaction in try-catch (already exists)
- [x] Continue processing even if individual transactions fail
- [x] Report successes and failures separately (already exists)
- [x] Show detailed error for each failed transaction (already exists)


## CURRENT TASK: Retry Failed Transactions

### Implementation
- [x] After batch completion, check if there are any failed transactions
- [x] If failures exist, add 🔄 reaction to completion message
- [x] Create reaction collector for 🔄 emoji (5 min timeout)
- [x] Extract failed transaction details from results
- [x] Reconstruct bids array with only failed transactions
- [x] Generate new preview with failed transactions
- [x] Allow user to confirm and retry
- [x] Add recursive retry button if retry also has failures


## CURRENT TASK: Fix Team Names & Validation

### Issues
1. "76ers" should map to "Sixers"
2. "Trail Blazers", "Trailblazers", "Blazers" should all map to same team
3. Sixers not showing up in 28 teams list
4. Player edit dropdown should only show 28 teams + Free Agents

### Tasks
- [x] Find where team validation/normalization happens (team-validator.ts)
- [x] Add team alias mapping (76ers → Sixers, Trailblazers/Blazers → Trail Blazers, etc.)
- [x] Fixed Sixers (was "76ers", now "Sixers" with "76ers" as alias)
- [x] Find player edit dropdown component (TeamAssignmentDialog.tsx)
- [x] Update dropdown to use validated team list only (imports VALID_TEAMS)
- [x] Removed Clippers and Thunder (not in league)
- [x] 28 teams + Free Agents = 29 total


## CURRENT TASK: FA Message Validation

### Team Name Validation
- [x] Check team name against VALID_TEAMS and aliases
- [x] If invalid, suggest closest match using fuzzy matching
- [x] Reply with helpful error message before rejecting
- [x] Show alias examples (76ers → Sixers, Blazers → Trail Blazers)

### Player Name Validation
- [x] Query database for signed player
- [x] Query database for dropped player (if specified)
- [x] If not found, use fuzzy matching to suggest similar names (top 3)
- [x] Reply with suggestions and tips if validation fails
- [x] Require drop player to be specified (no more "Unknown" team)


## CURRENT TASK: FA Transaction Management

### Transaction Reversal (FA Coins Page)
- [x] Add "Send All Back" button - full rollback (return signed player to FA, restore cut player, refund coins)
- [x] Add "Remove Signed Player" button - remove signed player only, refund coins, keep cut player removed
- [x] Add "Re-sign Cut Player" button - restore cut player to roster, keep signed player
- [x] Add "Return Coins" button - manual coin refund without roster changes
- [x] Create backend API endpoints for each reversal action
- [x] Add confirmation dialogs before executing reversals
- [x] Add dropdown menu with all 4 actions in transaction table

### Duplicate Drop Player Detection
- [x] When new bid is submitted, check if team has existing active bid with same drop player
- [x] If duplicate found, automatically cancel older bid (delete from faBids)
- [x] Log cancellation to console
- [x] Keep most recent bid as active
- [x] Prevents impossible scenarios (e.g., cutting Jaden Hardy twice)


## CURRENT TASK: Luke Kornet Assignment

### Goal
Assign Luke Kornet to Raptors roster (should have won FA bid)

### Tasks
- [x] Find Luke Kornet in database (ID found, 77 OVR)

- [ ] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Smart Player Name Fuzzy Matching

### Goal
Implement intelligent fuzzy matching that checks team roster first, handles misspellings, and filters out already-signed players

### Examples
- "vit kreji" (Jazz roster) → "Vít Krejčí" (check Jazz roster first)

- [ ] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Discord User ID → Team Mapping & Bug Fixes

### Issue 1: Team Detection Unreliable
Bot relies on drop player's team instead of Discord user ID - fails when nicknames change

### Issue 2: Incorrect Projected Cap Math
Raptors bid shows "Projected cap: 🟢 1082/1098 (-16)" but math is wrong

## CURRENT TASK: Fix Trade Voting Bugs

### Issue 1: Trade Not Rejected at Threshold
Trade with 5 downvotes not being rejected automatically

### Issue 2: Bot Deleting User's Reaction
Bot removes both its own reaction AND the user's first reaction - should only remove bot's reaction

### Tasks
- [x] Find trade voting logic in Discord bot (trade-voting.ts)
- [x] Check rejection threshold (was requiring upvotes < 7 AND downvotes >= 5)
- [x] Fix rejection logic to trigger at 5 downvotes regardless of upvotes (rejection takes priority)
- [x] Find reaction removal code (lines 228-258)
- [x] Analyzed: Bot reaction removal is correct - only removes bot's reaction
- [x] Root cause: User's reaction removed because they lack Trade Committee role (line 262)
- [x] Add better logging to identify which users lack role (shows user ID and emoji)
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Dev server running without errors
- [x] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Fix Trade Parser Embed Extraction

### Issue
Trade confirmation shows empty player lists because parser fails to extract names from Discord embed fields

### Tasks
- [x] Investigate trade-parser.ts embed extraction logic

FA bid parser can't match "vit kreji" to "Vít Krejčí" on Jazz roster, causing "Team Unknown" error

### Tasks
- [x] Check if Vít Krejčí exists on Jazz roster in database
- [x] Confirmed "vit kreji" alias already exists in code (line 94 of fa-bid-parser.ts)
- [x] Added debug logging to see if alias matches but player not found
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] Server restarted, user tested again - still failing
- [x] Alias exists in code but player not found in database
- [x] Query database to find exact spelling of Krejčí's name
- [x] Found: "Vít Krejčí" (73 OVR, Jazz) exists in database
- [x] Root cause: Line 190 was doing case-sensitive match (p.name === canonicalName)
- [x] Fixed: Changed to case-insensitive match (p.name.toLowerCase() === canonicalName.toLowerCase())
- [x] TypeScript compilation successful
- [x] User removed special characters from database (Vít Krejčí → Vit Krejci)
- [x] Updated alias to match: 'Vit Krejci': ['vit krejci', 'vit kreji', 'krejci', 'kreji']
- [x] Server restarted
- [ ] User to test
- [ ] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Disable Old Batch FA Handler

- [ ] Save checkpoint


## CURRENT TASK: Re-enable Manual Processing Reactions

### Requirements
- User 679275787664359435 needs two manual processing reactions:
  1. ❗ - Manually confirm bid is valid and count during active window
  2. ⚡ - Process winning bids and execute roster transactions

### Tasks
- [x] Check current ❗ handler implementation
- [x] ❗ handler already exists and works (lines 960-1039)
- [x] Re-enable ⚡ handler to use new FA bid system (not old batch system)
- [x] ⚡ now parses single bid, validates players, records to database
- [x] Both handlers check user ID (679275787664359435)
- [x] Server restarted
- [ ] User to test both reactions
- [ ] Save checkpoint
