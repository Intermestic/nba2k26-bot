## COMPLETED: Bot Offline & Roster Message Sorting Fix ✅

### Issues Fixed
1. ✅ Roster message sorting - Over-cap teams now appear at bottom instead of top
2. ✅ Discord roster message updated with new sorting (28 teams)
3. ✅ Bot initialization verified - Bot connects successfully when started
4. ✅ Updated 'ready' event to 'clientReady' to fix deprecation warning
5. ✅ Added detailed logging for bot startup process

### Tasks Completed
- [x] Check server logs for bot connection errors
- [x] Verify DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN environment variable is set
- [x] Check if bot is actually connected to Discord
- [x] Manually trigger roster message update via admin UI
- [x] Verify new sorting appears in Discord (over-cap teams at bottom)
- [x] Fix clientReady event deprecation
- [x] Test bot initialization manually
- [x] Save checkpoint

### Notes
- Bot successfully logs in as "HOF 2K Manus Bot#0960"
- All bot systems initialize correctly (FA monitoring, overcap roles, trade voting, etc.)
- Roster message sorting change: `aOverCap - bOverCap` (ascending) instead of `bOverCap - aOverCap` (descending)
- This puts teams under cap first, over-cap teams at bottom
