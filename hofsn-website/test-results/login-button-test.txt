Login Button Test - Jan 25, 2026

Dev Preview Test:
- URL: https://3000-ifhp9tb1f1hmyg1b0nb9a-f988e398.us2.manus.computer/
- Footer shows: "Admin Dashboard" button and "Logout" button
- This is because the user is already logged in as admin in the dev preview

The login button will show as "Admin Login" when the user is NOT logged in.
When logged in as admin, it shows "Admin Dashboard" and "Logout" buttons.

Implementation is correct:
- Not logged in: Shows "Admin Login" button (blue)
- Logged in as admin: Shows "Admin Dashboard" (gold) + "Logout" (gray)
- Logged in as non-admin: Shows only "Logout" (gray)
