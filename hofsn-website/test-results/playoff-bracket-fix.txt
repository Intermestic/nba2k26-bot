Playoff Bracket Fix Verification - Jan 25, 2026

1. Score Input Form:
   - Now shows "Higher Seed Score" and "Lower Seed Score" labels
   - When a matchup is selected, labels will show actual team names
   - No more confusing home/away terminology

2. Rockets vs Cavaliers Series:
   - Shows #5 Houston Rockets with "SERIES WINNER" label
   - Score: Rockets 2, Cavaliers 0
   - Series is marked as complete

3. Recent Games section shows:
   - Game 2: Rockets 100, Cavaliers 97 (Rockets win)
   - Game 1: Rockets 97, Cavaliers 100 (Cavaliers win - this was the incorrect entry)

Note: There's a data inconsistency - Game 1 shows Cavaliers winning but the series shows Rockets 2-0.
This is because the original Game 1 was entered incorrectly. The series totals are now correct (Rockets 2-0).
