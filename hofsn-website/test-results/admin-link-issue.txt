Admin Link Visibility Issue - Jan 25, 2026

The admin link is not showing in the footer on the published site (hofsn-sports-bu28nutg.manus.space).

The footer shows:
- "© 2024 Hall of Fame Basketball Association. All rights reserved."
- "HoFSN - Your source for NBA 2K26 league coverage"
- No Admin Dashboard button visible

This is because the user is not logged in on the published site, so isAdmin is false.

The issue is that the published site may have a different authentication state than the preview.
The user needs to be logged in as an admin on the published site to see the admin link.

Possible solutions:
1. Add a visible login button for users to authenticate
2. Check if the session cookie is being shared between preview and published site
3. The user may need to log in on the published domain
